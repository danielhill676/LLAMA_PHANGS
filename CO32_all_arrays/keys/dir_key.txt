# DIRECTORY MAPPING KEY
##########################################################################

# Key to map from target name to working directory name.

# N.B. You may not need this file!

# BY DEFAULT the working directory for any target is a directory with
# the same name as the target. The programs will create the
# appropriate directory in the imaging, postprocessing,
# etc. directories.

# This key allows targets to be mapped to other directories.

# The most common use is to combine several targets into a single
# directory. This comes up for PHANGS-ALMA in the context of linear
# mosaics. Several targets are observed and then larter combined into
# a single data cube. Thus we prefer to image and process these parts
# together in a single directory.

# The syntax for the key is space or tab delimited:

# Column 1: target name
# Column 2: working directory name
